            <h2>Writing Tips & Techniques</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Concrete Imagery:</strong> Paint vivid pictures with words. Show, don’t just tell.</li>
                <li><strong>Experiment with Form:</strong> Try new structures like haiku, sonnets, or free verse to challenge your style.</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace Revision:</strong> Good poetry emerges from rewriting. Don’t be afraid to refine and cut.</li>
                <li><strong>Read Widely:</strong> The more poetry you read, the richer your own writing becomes. Notice patterns, rhythms, and word choices.</li>
                <li><strong>Find Your Voice:</strong> Write in a way that feels authentic. Your unique perspective is your greatest tool.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Featured Poet of the Week -->
        <section class="workshop-section">
            <h2>Featured Poet of the Week</h2>
            <p><strong>Emily Dickinson (1830-1886):</strong></p>
            <p>Emily Dickinson’s poetry is known for its short lines, unique punctuation, and slant rhyme. She often focused on themes of nature, death, and immortality, capturing deep emotion with spare, delicate wording. Reading Dickinson encourages us to break from conventions and find power in brevity and quiet introspection.</p>
            <p><em>Try This:</em> Read one of Dickinson’s poems and then write your own poem where you pay attention to punctuation and line breaks, using them to create subtle pauses and emphases.</p>
